## <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/omaralsayed/inspire">Inspire</a>

Web project using Node.js and TensorFlow. Inspire allows you to upload an image and the application will return a caption that is relevant to the image within a few seconds. You may also generate random quotes and captions if you are looking for some inspiration!

## <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/omaralsayed/ceas-reimbursement">CEAS Reimbursement</a>

I have proposed to build a reimbursement form with automated emails and PDF building set up to automate the old paper-based process. I have led the programming of this project and successfully finished it and deployed it at https://tribunal.uc.edu/reimbursement/.

This project was developed using Drupal 8 while using HTML/Sass and vanilla JavaScript for the front-end and MySQL for the database. I've added data validation on the front-end and back-end.

> This web form has become the only method of submitting reimbursment requests in the College of Engineering and Applied Science Tribunal.
