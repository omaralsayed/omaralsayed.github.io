## Hey there!

My name is Omar and I'm currently completing a combined degree program for a Master of Science in Computer Science and a
Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering with a minor in Mathematics at the University of Cincinnati. I am set to graduate in Spring 2022.

I have previously interned at Honeywell and Fidelity Investments. I gained experience with tools like Node.js, Spring Framework, Angular, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and languages like C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and Python! I really enjoy full-stack and platform/back-end work!

I am the Director of MakeUC Hackathon and President of IEEE@UC and Eta Kappa Nu at UC.
