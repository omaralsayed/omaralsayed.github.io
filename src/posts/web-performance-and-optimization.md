In March 2020, I spoke about web performance and optimization in a survey talk at IEEE@UC alongside <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/noahbass">Noah Bass</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/snyderks">Kristian Snyder</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/isiah-lloyd">Isiah Lloyd</a>. See the video below.

We covered a survey of web topics, from image optimization and source code minification to content delivery networks:

1. Why does web performance matter? (00:57)
2. Introduction to the Google Chrome DevTools (03:43)
3. Tree shaking optimization (09:15)
4. Network optimizations (16:20)
5. Finally, caching files with service workers (24:37)
